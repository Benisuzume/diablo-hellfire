 ============================================================================

  This file contains most of the development history of Smacker.

  It contains changes, updates, and fixes in the Smacker Tools, the
  Smacker SDK, and the Smacker Xtra.

============================================================================

3.1 a - 9/29/97
---------------
Added MMX support throughout Smacker - playback can now be up to 200%
  faster on MMX machines!
Added the new SmackBlit API for all Smacker platforms - gives SDK users a
  high-performance, low-level blitting library.  Supports 1x, 2x,
  2x smoothed, 2x interlaced to either 8-bit or 16-bit surfaces! See the
  ExamSmkB.C example program for a nifty demo of this new API.
Added replacement blitters for machines where DirectDraw has been installed
  with using the SmackBuffer API - now, whenever possible, Smacker does its
  own direct to screen blitting rather than using DIBSections.
Added masked and merged blitting to the SmackBuffer, SmackBlit, and DOS
  SVGA blit libraries (for much faster transparencies).
The front-end can now process a group of files one-by-one instead of only
  as a group.
Added a cursor API for detecting software cursors and then easily hiding and
  restoring them (for direct to screen blitting or playback).
Rewrote the DirectSound support code - should now have perfect synch and
  work on most emulated sound drivers.
The Xtra and the scriptor now use the merging blitter for faster playback.
Added BitmapToBitmapMerge and BitmapToScreenMerge command to the scriptor.
Fixed a bug on the Mac when decompressing 16-bit, stereo sound.
Added a "Play Last" button on the player tab that will play the last Smacker
  animation that was compressed, mixed, played, etc.  Great for quickly
  viewing the last animation that you created.
Made the Smacker PC Xtra not use DirectSound unless you call the new
  SmackUseDirectSound global command.
Added a 2x playback mode to the Smacker Xtra (including interlaced and
  smoothed modes).
Added a SmackHideVideo command to the Smacker Xtra which allows you to
  hide the video without closing the Smacker object.
Added a SmackSetAlignment command to the Smacker Xtra to control how the
  playback window is automatically aligned.
Added the SmackScreenMethod call to the PC Xtra.
Switched to MASM 6.11 for most of the assembly files.
Added error return codes to the SmackSetTransBackground in the Xtra.
Fixed a playback bug in the Xtra when using a cast member background.
