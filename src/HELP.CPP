"Prepare to be taken into the very depths of hell on your quest to destroy the Lord "
"of all Evil - Diablo.|"
"|"
"This Help section is designed to make your playing experience as easy as possible. "
"Let's get started...|"
"|"
"$Keyboard Shortcuts:|"
"Hellfire can be played exclusively by using the mouse controls.  There are times, however, "
"when you may want to use shortcuts to some commands by using the keyboard.  These "
"shortcuts are listed below:|"
"|"
"F1: Open the Help Screen|"
"Esc: Displays the main menu|"
"Tab: Displays the Auto-map|"
"Space: Removes all screens and map from the play area|"
"S: Opens Spell selection pop-up menu|"
"I: Opens the Inventory screen|"
"C: Opens the Character screen|"
"Z: Zooms the game screen in and out|"
"F: Reduces the brightness of the screen|"
"G: Increases the brightness of the screen|"
"Shift + Left Click: Fire any Bow without moving|"
"1,2,3: While the Spell selection pop-up menu is active, these keys will "
"set that number as a hot-key selection (pressing the number will "
"automatically ready that spell).|"
"|"
"$Movement:|"
"Movement is controlled by the mouse.  The gauntlet on the screen is your cursor. "
"Use this to indicate the destination of your character and then left-click to move "
"to that area.|"
"|"
"$Selecting Items:|"
"What you can interact with within the game is easily identifiable.  Simply move the "
"cursor over any object or creature.  If the object can be picked up, attacked, activated "
"or used in any way, it will be immediately outlined and highlighted with a description of "
"the object appearing in the text area on the control panel.|"
"|"
"Example: If you select a door and then left-click the character will walk to the door and "
"open it.  A second click closes the door.  If you left-click on a selected weapon, the "
"character will walk over to it and put it in his inventory. If you left-click on a selected "
"creature....|"
"|"
"$Combat:|"
"Combat is initiated by left-clicking on a creature that has been selected.  Left-clicking "
"on a creature that you are next to will cause your character to attack it immediately. "
"Left-clicking on a distant creature will cause the character to walk to the creature and "
"then attack. This will work if your character has a melee weapon (sword, mace, club, etc.), "
"just a shield or is unarmed.|"
"|"
"If your character is equipped with a bow, left-clicking will fire an arrow at a selected "
"creature. Holding down the shift key and then left-clicking allows the character to fire "
"the bow without accidentally moving.|"
"|"
"$Picking up Objects:|"
"If you left-click an item - such as a weapon, armor, scroll or book - your character will "
"move to that item and add it to his inventory automatically.  If you do not have enough "
"room in your inventory for the item, it will fall from your grasp and you will receive a "
"message that more room is needed.  Open your inventory screen and try re-arranging or "
"removing items to carry what you really want or need.|"
"|"
"$Inventory:|"
"You can toggle the Inventory screen on and off by clicking the INV> button on the control "
"panel.  Items may be moved around in your inventory by selecting them and then left-clicking "
"to pick them up.  When you pick up an item while in the inventory screen, your cursor "
"changes into the item. You can then place this item into empty spaces in your inventory, "
"swap them with other items in your inventory or equip them.|"
"|"
"If you have an item that you no longer wish to carry, simply grab the item from your "
"inventory and then left-click in the play area to drop it.|"
"|"
"$Equipping Items:|"
"Equipping items is done by picking up an item from your inventory and placing it in the "
"appropriate boxes on the figure in the Inventory screen. Weapons and shields go into the "
"large spaces to the  right or left of the figure. Two-handed weapons such as bows and "
"axes preclude the use of a shield and will take up both of these large spaces.|"
"|"
"Cloaks, robes, capes and all other armor must go in the central torso slot of the figure.|"
"|"
"Helmets and caps  go in the head box and rings go into the small boxes at the hands of "
"the figure.|"
"|"
"To change items that your character has equipped, pick up a new item and place it on top "
"of the item you wish to remove.  Your character will automatically swap the items and the "
"cursor will now change into the item that was in that box.|"
"|"
"$Usable Items:|"
"Potions, elixirs, oils and books are classified as usable items.  These items can be used "
"by right-clicking on them in the inventory screen.  Any one item can also be 'readied' in "
"the same way as spells. To ready an item, left-click the 'select current item' button to "
"the left of the red health ball on the control panel. "
"A pop-up menu will activate that you can scroll through to choose an item to be readied. "
"Left-click when the desired item is selected and you will see that item displayed on the "
"button.  To use a readied item, simply right-click on the 'select current item' button or "
"press the Enter key on your keyboard.|"
"|"
"$Item Information:|"
"All items in Hellfire share certain common attributes.  These are damage, durability, charges "
"and minimum requirements.|"
"|"
"Damage: This is represented by a range that shows the minimum and maximum damage that item "
"can inflict. An sword that has a (2-6) after its name does a minimum of two damage and a "
"maximum of six when it hits. Damage can be modified by the quality of the weapon, the "
"characters strength and magic.|"
"|"
"Durability: This is how long an item can last before it is rendered useless. This is "
"represented by a ratio of current durability to maximum durability. A shield that has a "
"durability of 15/20 would have 15 points of damage it could take from use before it was "
"rendered useless. Maximum durability can be affected by the quality of the item, magic or "
"repairs upon the item. Minimum durability can be raised by repairing an item.|"
"When the durability of an item you are wearing or wielding drops to 5 points or below, "
"an icon of the image appears in the lower left corner above the control panel. These icons "
"warn the player that the item is about to break and needs to be repaired soon.|"
"|"
"Charges: Some items have charges associated with. These represent how many times that item "
"can be used to cast the spell or affect indicated in its description.  Charges are "
"represented by a ratio of charges left to maximum charges. A staff that has charges of "
"2/5 could be used to cast 2 more spells before it was rendered powerless (it could still "
"be used to attack with physically). Maximum charges can be affected by the magic or "
"recharges cast upon the item. Minimum charges can be raised by recharging the item.|"
"|"
"Minimum Requirements: These are the minimum requirements that a character must meet to "
"wield the item. The more powerful an item is, the higher the minimum requirements will be. "
"If a character does not meet these requirements, he will be unable to equip the item and "
"its name and information will be displayed in red.  The item artwork will also have a red "
"tint to it in the Inventory screen.|"
"|"
"There are also three classes of items in Hellfire.  These are mundane, magic and Unique:|"
"|"
"Mundane items have no special attributes and their information is displayed in white text.|"
"|"
"Magic Items are represented by blue text descriptions. Use the Identify spell to determine "
"their exact properties and attributes.|"
"|"
"Unique items are fully identified when you obtain them. Information on these items is "
"displayed in gold.|"
"|"
"$Skills:|"
"Important Note - Skills do not work in the town in this pre-release demo. Left-clicking "
"on the 'select current spell' button will open a pop-up menu that will allow you to ready "
"a skill or spell for use.  To use a readied skill or spell, simply right-click in the main "
"play area.|"
"|"
"Skills are the innate abilities of your character. These skills are different depending on "
"what class you choose and they require no mana to use.|"
"|"
"The Warrior starts the game with the Repair skill.  The Repair Skill icon appears as the "
"'select current spell' button found next to the blue Mana sphere on the control panel. "
"When the skill is useable, the button will be gold in color.  The game starts with the "
"button grayed out as you cannot repair or cast spells in the town.|"
"|"
"The Repair skill allows the Warrior to fix an item that has been worn by use or is damaged "
"in combat.  To repair an item, have the Repair Skill selected (your character starts the "
"game this way) and right-click the mouse as if you were casting a spell.  Your cursor will "
"change into a hammer shaped cursor that you will use to select the item to be repaired. "
"Repairing an item will decrease the maximum durability of that item, but can be done while "
"in the labyrinth.|"
"|"
"The Blacksmith can repair items, but it will cost you gold. When the Blacksmith repairs "
"an item, it does not decrease the maximum durability of the item.|"
"|"
"$Spells:|"
"Important Note - Spells do not work in the town in this pre-release demo.|"
"|"
"Spells are magical effects that can be cast from a scroll, a staff or memorized from a "
"book.  Spells may or may not require mana to use and are available to all classes.|"
"|"
"Spells cast from an item (a scroll or staff) cost no mana to use, but are limited by "
"the number of charges available on the item.  Scrolls always have one charge while staves "
"may have multiple charges. To use spells from a staff, you must equip the staff to cast "
"the spell. Spells that are cast from staves are represented by an orange icon button in "
"the 'select current spell' button area.  Scrolls are represented by a red button.|"
"|"
"Memorized spells cost mana to cast, but they can be used as long as the character has "
"mana to power them.  The Warrior starts the game with no memorized spells.  If the "
"character finds a book in the labyrinth, he can memorize the spell written in that "
"book by opening the Inventory screen and right-clicking on the book.  This will make "
"the spell always available to the character for casting.  Memorized spells are denoted "
"by a blue button.|"
"|"
"While some spells affect the caster, some spells require a target. These targeted spells "
"are cast in the direction that you indicate with your cursor on the play area.  If you "
"highlight a creature, you will cast that spell at that creature.  Not all items within "
"the labyrinth can be targeted.|"
"|"
"Example: A fireball spell will travel at the creature or to the location you right-click "
"on.  A Healing spell will simply add health to your character while diminishing his "
"available mana and requires no targeting.|"
"|"
"You can also set a spell or scroll as a Hot Key position for instant selection.  Start "
"by opening the pop-up menu as described in the skill section above.  Assign Hot Keys by "
"hitting the 1, 2 or 3 keys on your keyboard after scrolling through the available spells "
"and skills and stopping on the one you wish to assign.|"
"|"
"$Health and Mana:|"
"The two spheres in the control panel display your health and mana.  Your health is a "
"measure of how much life force your character has.  The red sphere of fluid on the left "
"side of the control panel represents the health of your character.  When the fluid is "
"gone - your character is dead.|"
"|"
"The blue fluid on the right side of the control panel represents your character's "
"available mana. Mana is the magical force used by your character to cast spells.  When "
"the liquid in the sphere is low or depleted, you may be unable to cast some (or all) of "
"your spells.|"
"|"
"$Control Panel:|"
"The control panel is how you receive detailed information in Hellfire and interact with "
"much of your surroundings.  Here is a quick run-down of the control panel areas and their "
"use:|"
"|"

"Description Area: This is where any important information about creatures or items "
"you can interact with is displayed.|"
"|"
"Character Info:|"
"Toggle the Character Statistics Screen on and off by clicking the <CHAR button on the "
"control panel.  This screen shows the 'nuts and bolts' of your character.  There are "
"four major statistics that dictate how your character progresses in the game.|"
"|"
"STRENGTH: This is how physically powerful your character is. This statistic plays a "
"large part in  determining how much damage you can do when attacking creatures.|"
"|"
"MAGIC: This is how attuned your character is with the arcane powers of the world. "
"This statistic plays a large part in  determining how much mana you have available "
"for casting spells.|"
"|"
"DEXTERITY: This is how quick of foot and hand your character is. This statistic plays "
"a large part in  determining the chance you have to hit creatures in combat.|"
"|"
"VITALITY: This is how physically fit your character is. This statistic plays a large "
"part in  determining how much health your character has when he is undamaged.|"
"|"
"$Main Menu:|"
"To activate the Game Menu, click the button with the pentagram symbol on the left "
"of the control panel.  You have three options in this menu.|"
"|"
"Save: This saves the game you are currently playing. Please note that this pre-release "
"demo will only save one game at a time.  Saving overwrites any previously saved game.|"
"|"
"Load: This loads the last game that you have saved.|"
"|"
"Quit: This exits the program. Please note that this does not automatically save your "
"game. If you wish to save the game you are currently playing, select save game before "
"quitting.|"
"|"

"the auto-map, click the button with the compass symbol on the left of the control panel. "
"You can also hit the TAB key on your keyboard to activate the auto-map.  You can zoom in "
"and out of the map with the + and - keys.  Scrolling the map is done with the arrow keys.|"
"|"
"$Tech support:|"
"This is a pre-release version of Hellfire.  We have tried to make this as bug free as possible. "
"There will be no patches or updates of this pre-release demo available. The version will "
"not be supported by our tech support lines.|"

"worn by use or is damaged in combat. To accomplish this, select the Repair Skill through "
"the Spellbook or Speedbook and right-click the mouse as if you were casting a spell. "

"by an orange icon/button in the 'select current spell' area.|"
"|"
"Spells that are memorized cost mana to cast, but they can be used as long as the "
"character has mana to power them. The Warrior and Rogue start the game with no memorized "
"spells while the sorcerer begins with Firebolt.  If the character finds a book in the "
"labyrinth, he can memorize the spell written in that book by opening the Inventory "

"$Equipping Items:|"
"To equip an item, open the inventory screen and pick up the desired item, either from "

"$Item Information:|"
"Many items in Hellfire share certain common attributes.  These are damage, durability, "
"charges and minimum requirements..|"
"|"
"Damage: This is represented by a range that indicates the minimum and maximum damage "
"that item can inflict. A short sword has a (2-6) after its name, meaning it inflicts a "
"minimum of two damage and a maximum of six when it hits. Damage can be modified by the "
"quality of the weapon, the character's strength and magical effects.|"
"|"
"Durability: This is the amount of damage that an item can take before it is rendered "
"useless. Durability is represented by a ratio of current durability to maximum "
"durability. A shield that has a durability of 15/20 would still have 15 points of "
"damage it could take from use before it was rendered useless. Maximum durability can "
"be affected by the quality of the item, enchantments or repairs made upon the item. "
"The minimum durability can be raised by repairing an item.|"
"|"
"Charges: Some items have charges associated with them. Charges indicate how many times "
"that item can be used to cast the spell or affect indicated in its description.  Charges "
"are represented by a ratio of charges left to maximum charges. A staff that has charges "
"listed as 2/5 could be used to cast 2 more spells before it was rendered powerless. It "
"could still be used to attack with as a physical weapon, however. Maximum charges can "
"be affected by the magic or recharges cast upon the item. Minimum charges can be raised "
"by recharging the item.|"
"|"
"Minimum Requirements: These are the minimum requirements that a character must meet to "
"wield the item. The more powerful an item is, the higher the minimum requirements will "
"be.  If a character does not meet these requirements, he will be unable to equip the "
"item and its name and information will be displayed in red.  The item artwork will also "
"have a red tint in the Inventory screen.|"
"|"
"$Items Classes:|"
"There are three classes of items in Hellfire - Mundane, Magic and Unique:|"
"|"
"Mundane items have no special attributes. Their information is displayed in white text.|"
"|"
"Magic Items are represented by blue names and text descriptions. Use the Identify spell "
"or speak to Cain in town to determine their exact properties and attributes.|"
"|"
"Unique items are represented by gold names and text descriptions. Use the Identify spell "
"or speak to Cain in town to determine their exact properties and attributes.|"
"|"
"$Skills & Spells:|"
"You can access your list of skills and spells by left-clicking on the SPELLS button in "
"the interface bar. This 'Spellbook' contains all of the skills and spells that your "
"character knows. Spells available through staffs are also listed here. Left-clicking "
"on the Icon of the spell you wish to ready will place it in the 'select current spell' "
"icon/area and set it as the current readied spell. A readied spell may be cast by simply "
"right-clicking in the play area.|"
"|"
"Left-clicking on the 'select current spell' button will also open a 'Speedbook' menu "

"Important Note - Skills are non-functional in the town for this Battle.net Beta. |"
"|"
"Skills are the innate abilities of your character. These skills are different depending "
"on what class you choose and require no mana to use.|"
"|"
"Warrior:|"
"The Warrior has the skill of Repair Items. This allows him to fix an item that has been "
"worn by use or is damaged in combat. To accomplish this, select the Repair Skill through "
"the Spellbook or Speedbook and right-click the mouse as if you were casting a spell. "
"Your cursor will change into a Hammer Icon that you will use to select the item to be "
"repaired.  Although Repairing an item in this way will decrease the maximum durability "
"of that item, it can be done without leaving the labyrinth.|"
"|"
"The Blacksmith can also repair items for a price. When the Blacksmith performs this "
"service, it does decrease the maximum durability of the item.|"
"|"
"Rogue:|"
"The Rogue has the skill of Disarm Traps. This allows her to not only remove traps, but "
"also acts as a 'sixth sense' that warns her of where these trapped items are located. "
"To accomplish this, select the Disarm Trap skill through the Spellbook or Speedbook and "
"right-click the mouse as if you were casting a spell.  Your cursor will change into a "
"Targeting Cursor that you will use to select the item to be disarmed.  The success of "
"this attempt is based on the level of the Rogue and the expertise of whomever set the trap.|"
"|"
"Sorcerer:|"
"The Sorcerer has the skill of Recharge Staffs. This allows him to focus his mana into "
"an staff that has been drained of its magical energies.  To accomplish this, select "
"the Recharge Staffs skill through the Spellbook or Speedbook and right-click the mouse "
"as if you were casting a spell.  Your cursor will change into a Staff Icon that you will "
"use to select the item to be recharged.  Although Recharging a staff in this way will "
"decrease its maximum charges, it can be done without leaving the labyrinth.|"
"|"
"The Witch can also recharge staffs for a price. When the Witch performs this service, it "
"does decrease the maximum charges of the item.|"
"|"
"$Spells:|"
"Important note - Spells are non-functional in the town for this Battle.net Beta.|"
"|"
"Spells are magical effects that can be cast from a scroll, a staff or memorized from a "
"book. Spells may or may not require mana to use and are available to all classes.|"
"|"
"Spells cast from a scroll cost no mana to use, but are limited to only one charge. "
"Casting a spell from a scroll is accomplished by either right clicking on the scroll "
"or, if it is located in our belt, pressing the corresponding number on the keyboard. "
"Scrolls can also be readied in the Speedbook and are represented by a red icon/button "
"in the 'select current spell' area.|"
"|"
"Spells cast from staffs cost no mana to use, but are limited by the number of charges "
"available. To cast spells from a staff, it must first be equipped. The 'select current "
"spell' icon/button will change to indicate that the spell on the staff is currently ready "
"to cast. Scrolls can also be readied in the Spellbook or Speedbook and are represented "
"by an orange icon/button in the 'select current spell' area.|"
"|"
"Spells that are memorized cost mana to cast, but they can be used as long as the "
"character has mana to power them. The Warrior and Rogue start the game with no memorized "
"spells while the sorcerer begins with Firebolt.  If the character finds a book in the "
"labyrinth, he can memorize the spell written in that book by opening the Inventory "
"screen and right-clicking on the book.  This will make that spell always available to "
"the character for casting. Memorized spells can be readied through either the Spellbook "
"or Speedbook and are represented by a blue icon/button in the 'select current spell' area.|"
"|"
"$Important note on books:|"
"$Reading more than one book increases your knowledge of that spell and gives you the "
"spell at a higher level. The higher the level of a spell the more effective it is.|"
"|"
"While some spells affect the caster, other spells require a target. These targeted spells "
"are cast in the direction that you indicate with your cursor on the play area.  If you "
"highlight a creature, you will cast that spell at that creature.  Not all items within "
"the labyrinth can be targeted.|"
"|"
"Example: A fireball spell will travel at the creature or to the location you right-click "
"on.  A Healing spell will simply add health to your character while diminishing his "
"available mana and requires no targeting.|"
"|"
"You can also set a spell or scroll as a Hot Key position for instant selection.  Start "
"by opening the pop-up menu as described in the skill section above.  Assign Hot Keys by "
"hitting the F5, F6, F7 or F8 keys on your keyboard after scrolling through the available "
"spells and highlighting the one you wish to assign. |"
"|"
"$Health and Mana:|"
"The two orbs in the Information Bar display your life and mana. The red sphere of fluid "
"on the left side of the control panel represents the overall health of your character. "
"When the fluid is gone - your character is dead.|"
"|"
"The blue fluid on the right side of the control panel represents your character's "
