Okay, so the random item generator has determined that you may deserve a random unique of a certain type (say, rings).

Now it goes through the list of uniques, and sees if there are any that you're allowed to have on that dungeon level (plus a few if you're getting this from a unique critter) that you haven't already found this session.

It then takes the last one of those it finds (which is, presumably, the highest-level-and-therefore-best), and gives it to you.

Me, I would've made that last step just a random pick from the list (perhaps weighted toward the highest-level one), but what do I know?
