[1] WHAT THE PATCH FIXES
====================================
This patch provides fixes and enhancements to the Hellfire 1.00 product. It provides a new executable (HELLFIRE.EXE), an interface library (HELLFRUI.DLL), a patch text file (Patch.txt), and a version text file (Version.txt.


List of changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Fixed Gossip (same gossip from each towner every time)
-  Fixed disappearing quests (upon re-entering the town level, quest statuses were incorrectly cleared through array bounds overstep).
-  Fixed generating spell books by Adria (would "morph" on new game).
-  Fixed the bug where picking up gold when your inventory is full duplicates the gold in your hand and fills your gold slot.
-  Fixed the Berserk spell to prevent crashes (large numbers of berserk monsters occasionally attacked dead monsters).
-  Fixed inactive monsters to prevent same kind of crash as above
-  Fixed entering levels; had crashed on some systems (seemingly randomly).
-  Fixed doppelganger's items to not clone Diablo
-  Fixed generating rings of fire behind a wall.
-  Sped up monk's open-hand attack (users complained he should be faster with feet than with the sweeping staff).
-  Various small internal fixes to prevent potential misbehavior.
-  Fixed monster hitpoint variable type for tough monsters (some monsters, especially in Nightmare/Hell difficulty, had way fewer hit points than specified)
-  Changed Search spell to show items on automap, too (users complained they couldn't find things behind solid walls in Caves, Nest, Crypt).
-  Fix to unique items changing between games (veil of steel, arkaine's valor, etc).
-  Fixed to dropping and picking back up oiled items (bonus was lost).
-  Fixed Cathedral Map activation crash bug
-  Added sounds to Mana Drain and Disenchant traps
-  Monster hit points in Nightmare/Hell are +100/200 instead of +1.5/+3
-  Fixed monster stats display in Nightmare/Hell to reflect the halving.
-  Balance/Stability/Harmony now does something
